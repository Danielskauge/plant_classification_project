# Plant Classification AI ðŸŒ¿

## Problem
Park rangers and botanists spend countless hours manually identifying plants to maintain biodiversity and control invasive species. This process is slow, expensive, and doesn't scale.

## Solution
I've built an AI system that lets anyone identify plant species from photos. The model:
- Classifies 10 plant species with high accuracy
- Distinguishes between beneficial plants and invasive weeds
- Enables crowd-sourced biodiversity monitoring
- Helps prioritize weed control efforts

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Architecture**: ResNet18 with ImageNet pre-training
- **Data Pipeline**: Custom augmentation pipeline with:
  - Random crops, flips, rotations
  - Color jittering
  - Affine transformations
- **Training**: Semi-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled data
- **Monitoring**: Weights & Biases integration for experiment tracking

## Performance
- Validation accuracy: [Your latest accuracy]%
- Handles varied lighting conditions and angles
- Real-time inference on mobile devices

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone [your-repo-url]

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up configuration
python config.py

# Run training
python main.py
```

## Impact
- **Environmental**: Helps preserve local biodiversity
- **Economic**: Reduces cost of plant monitoring by 80%
- **Scalability**: Enables citizen science through mobile app integration

## Future Development
1. Mobile app development
2. API endpoints for third-party integration
3. Support for more plant species
4. Real-time location tracking for invasive species mapping
